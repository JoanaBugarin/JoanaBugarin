## About me
Hi, I’m Joana Soledad Bugarin. I was born the third of December, nineteen ninety one in Necochea, Buenos Aires province.
I am passionate about learning, overcoming challenges, perfecting my skills, cooking, playing video games and role-playing games, reading all kinds of books and comics, living a healthy and happy life, traveling, watching series, movies and anime, and above all facing new experiences that improve my life.
I am currently learning full-stack web development through Argentina Programa #YoProgramo, after having approved the previous stage #SéProgramar. This program is provided by the Ministry of Productive Development of Argentina and certified by CESSI (Chamber of the Argentine Software Industry). I also take a manual testing course with an introduction to the world of testing automation, dictated by the IT workers union AGC.
